Startup Brandlight has secured $5.75 million in pre-seed funding to help brands influence how they appear across [AI-driven platforms](https://www.adweek.com/category/artificial-intelligence-2/) like ChatGPT and Perplexity.
VC firms Cardumen Capital and G20 Ventures led the round, with additional investors and advisors including Tony Weisman [(former chief marketing officer at Dunkin)](https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/dunkin-cmo-steps-down/), David Edelman (Aetna’s former CMO), Sarah Fay (chair of the board of directors, [Ziff Davis)](https://www.adweek.com/media/ziff-davis-acquires-theskimm-marking-the-end-of-an-era/), and John Nardone (CEO at JW Player and Connatix). 
Brandlight runs millions of prompts across AI search engines for marketers. The firm analyzes which queries surface brands, how AI categorizes brands with positive or negative sentiment, what topics or categories brands appears under, and how competitors rank.
The goal is to help brands boost both sentiment and visibility across a growing landscape of AI interfaces.
