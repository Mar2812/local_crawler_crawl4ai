# Tariff Headwinds Shook the Markets, But Not Arthur Sadoun's Confidence
## Publicis Groupe CEO says clients are 'cautious but combative' following a strong Q1

2025 ad spend forecasts have been cut amid the economic disruption caused by President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again tariffs. However, Publicis Groupe [started the year strong](https://www.adweek.com/agencies/publicis-posts-49-organic-growth-in-q1-following-winning-streak/), and CEO Arthur Sadoun is optimistic it can sustain momentum and help brands do the same.
The business [delivered 4.9%](https://www.adweek.com/agencies/publicis-posts-49-organic-growth-in-q1-following-winning-streak/) year-on-year organic growth in Q1, with revenue up 9.4% year-on-year to €3.5 billion ($4.6 billion). 
Twelve new clients offset what the French network described as “deteriorating macroeconomic conditions.” Wins included nabbing Coca-Cola’s [$700 million media account from WPP](https://www.adweek.com/agencies/publicis-nabs-coca-cola-us-media-business-from-wpp/) and creating a bespoke agency to handle creative, media, and production for Santander.
With uncertainty set to rumble through 2025, Sadoun is confident the ad giant can sustain its momentum and help brands do the same. 
#### **Cautious but combative**
The company is sticking with its guidance to deliver between 4% and 5% organic growth in 2025.
“The client mood at the moment is cautious, but they are very combative,” Sadoun told ADWEEK, noting an appetite for “more targeted communication and measurement.”
In March, WARC revised its global 2025 ad spend forecast to $1.15 trillion, down one percentage point from November 2024 to 6.7%. IPG Mediabrands’ [Magna unit also recently cut its 2025 U.S. forecast](https://www.adweek.com/convergent-tv/3-things-marketers-know-about-magna-2025-ad-forecast-update/), projecting a 4.3% increase in ad budgets, down from 4.9% in December 2024.
Amid this, a [gloomy forecast from rival WPP](https://www.adweek.com/agencies/wpp-forecasts-2025-revenue-drop-as-weak-results-send-shares-tumbling/), and market turmoil triggered by Trump’s plans, Publicis Groupe’s stock fell nearly 16% during the first quarter and continued to weaken in early April.
However, the Saatchi & Saatchi owner’s biggest month for billings in Q1 came in March as the levies loomed large. Sadoun said this shows brands are still investing short-term to maintain, or gain, market share.
Sadoun has noticed an increasing “wait and see attitude” among clients around long-term budgets. “Until there is more clarity, this is not going to get better,” he said. 
The CEO said it’s too early to conclude what the lack of clarity around tariffs means for global or U.S. advertisers. “The truth is, we’ve been through a crazy week, and the stock market has been yo-yo-ing for the last few weeks.”
“Fortunately, it did not–so far–have an economic impact, but if we want to avoid a [wider] crisis, we will need more stability and clarity pretty fast,” he added.
Fifteen percent of Publicis’ Q1 net revenue came from healthcare (it is Pfizer’s AOR), with automotive and financial contributing 13% each.
North America’s net revenue was up 11.3%, with organic growth of 4.8%, while Europe’s sat at 2.7%. China’s increased by 9.3%.
#### **M &A and a ‘shrinking landscape’**
Publicis has been investing in delivering personalized messaging at scale since it purchased data platform Epsilon for $4 billion in 2019. 
At the start of this year, it acquired first-party data business [Lotame to help it reach 91% of adult internet users globally](https://www.adweek.com/agencies/inside-publicis-groupes-surprise-acquisition-of-id-business-lotame/). 
Sadoun said these additions, its new business wins, its evolving AI tools, and the $800 to $900 million it has earmarked for investment in 2025, [focused on areas including digital media and technology](https://www.adweek.com/agencies/publicis-arthur-sadoun-opportunity-omnicom-ipg-takeover/), meant the agency network was in a “strong position to help clients in good times and bad.”
The business ended 2024 as the largest advertising and marketing services company among the “big six.” However, if [Omnicom’s proposed takeover of IPG](https://www.adweek.com/agencies/disapprove-omnicom-ipg/) passes regulatory scrutiny, it will leapfrog into the top spot with a combined revenue of around $25.6 billion, based on 2023 figures.
Sadoun said the ad industry was “growing by itself” through a “shrinking competitive landscape” since 90% of new business wins would come from three big players (Omnicom, Publicis, and WPP) versus four with IPG out of the picture.
“A lot is going on at the moment when it comes to clients and talent due to this takeover,” he said, stopping short of any details.

As he looks to Cannes Lions, only one thing is certain: things will still be uncertain for agencies and clients.
“[Conversations there] will have to be about client growth, innovation, and the role data, technology, and AI can play into that,” he said.
